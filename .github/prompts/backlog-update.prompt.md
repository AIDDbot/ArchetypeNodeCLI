# Backlog Update Document

Update the BACKLOG document to reflect the current status of features and epics in the project.

## Context

- [BACKLOG.md](/docs/BACKLOG.md)
- [BACKLOG instructions](/.github/instructions/BACKLOG.instructions.md)

## Workflow

### Adding a new feature or epic

- [ ] If a new feature or epic is added, ensure it is documented in the BACKLOG.
- [ ] Use the format specified in the BACKLOG instructions to maintain consistency.

### Updating existing features or epics

- [ ] If the status of an existing feature or epic changes, update the BACKLOG to reflect the new status.
- [ ] Use the color codes for feature status:
  - ðŸ”µ RELEASED
  - ðŸŸ¢ CODED
  - ðŸŸ¡ DESIGNED
  - ðŸŸ  PENDING
  - ðŸ”´ BLOCKED
- [ ] Ensure the epics table is updated with the correct feature status.

### When a feature is implemented

- [ ] When a feature status is set to ðŸŸ¢ CODED or ðŸ”µ RELEASED
 - [ ] Change any dependant features statuses if they are affected by the change. 
 - [ ] If a dependant feature is ðŸ”´ BLOCKED, change its status to ðŸŸ  PENDING.

### After updating the BACKLOG

- If the project uses GitHub Issues:
  - [ ] Run the [/github-issues](../prompts/github-issues.prompt.md) prompt to synchronize GitHub issues with the BACKLOG.
