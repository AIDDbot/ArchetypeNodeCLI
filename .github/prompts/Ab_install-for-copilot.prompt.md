# Install AIDDbot for GitHub Copilot

Copy the `.github` directory from the [AIDDbot/AIDDbot](https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot) to the current repository.

## Goal

Have the same `.github` directory structure as the source repository, which includes prompts, workflows, and configurations for GitHub Copilot.

## Context

- The source `.github` directory is at https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot/tree/main/.github
- The target `.github` directory is or will be at [/.github](/.github)

## Workflow

- [ ] **1. Navigate to your local repository**

First, ensure you are in the root directory of your local repository where you want the `.github` folder to be placed.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/local/repo
```

- [ ] **2. Clone the source repository to a temporary location**

This command will create a local copy of the `AIDDbot/AIDDbot` repository in a new directory named `AIDDbot-temp`. This temporary clone is what we will use to grab the `.github` folder.

```bash
git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/AIDDbot/AIDDbot.git AIDDbot-temp
```

- [ ] **3. Copy the `.github` directory**

Now, use a file system command to copy the `.github` directory and its entire contents from the temporary clone into your current repository. The `-r` flag ensures that the copy is recursive, including all subdirectories and files.

```bash
cp -r AIDDbot-temp/.github .
```

_Note: The `.` at the end of the command signifies your current directory (the root of your local repository)._

- [ ] **4. Clean up the temporary clone**

Finally, you can remove the temporary directory you created in step 2. This removes all the temporary files and the Git history you no longer need.

```bash
rm -rf AIDDbot-temp
```

- [ ] **5. Add and commit the new files**

The files have been copied to your local file system, but they are not yet part of your Git history. Use the following commands to stage and commit them.

```bash
git add .github
git commit -m "Add .github directory from AIDDbot repository"
```

You have now successfully copied the `.github` directory from the source repository and added it to your own local repository's history without maintaining any direct Git link to the original source.

## Validation

- [ ] Use the #editFiles tool to verify temporary files are not left behind.
- [ ] Use the #editFiles tool to ensure the `.github` directory is copied correctly
- [ ] Use the #changes tool to track changes in the repository.
